                improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from
                Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.
                Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious
                and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think
                Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
                the streets of Charlotte.

                Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare
                and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the
                convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
                don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a
                
                master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast,
                Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the
                Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.
